## Fabriq and UpLift Example
I could name countless examples of hyper learning in my career. One of my projects with [UpLift](https://www.uplift.app/) had me re-examining their mood journal, a short questionnaire that users were supposed to check-in 2-4 times per day. It gave the user a slider from 0-100 to track their mood, and a few free response questions to to reflect on what might be influencing their mood.

At the time, I believed we should make the free response questions into multi-select questions, reducing the friction to enter data and thus increasing check-in frequency. This would also allow us to draw connections for the user, like "You tend to feel worse when you don't sleep well. Would you like to go through our sleep module?" I also believed that, since the mood journal was a behavior that would happen multiple times per day, it could serve as a gateway behavior to other alternatives. If people were feeling bad, we could recommend they try out one of our mood boosters, or that they go through a longer [CBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) learning session. 

Through conversations with Spencer Greenberg of [[Spark Wave]], I realized that only power users would do enough mood journal entries to reveal quantified self metrics that provided anything novel. What would be better is to ask the user to pause and reflect, because then they would be able to notice patterns between their mood and their experience in the moment. The quantified self metrics were out, but treating the mood journal as a gateway behavior remained.

At the moment of writing this, I've been working with [Fabriq](https://www.ourfabriq.com/) for almost a year. They were considering adding a mood journal to their app and wanted my help. Because I had documented my experience with UpLift, I knew a few things to be true:

* Behavioral responses to mood tracking make the check-ins meaningful.
* Quantified self metrics tracked over time related to mood will rarely provide novel insight beyond what could be gained from simply pausing and reflecting on a good question in the moment.
* Mood tracking in an app built for helping people work through depression makes sense as a primitive. It may not in an app that's built to improve your feelings of social connectedness.

In Fabriq, when a user logs a connection with one of their contacts, they are also able to pull a slider to note down high quality the connection was. They can also optionally note down what contributed to their connection quality to reflect more deeply. 

Originally, the idea they put in front of me asked the user to track their mood every few days. However, mood is influenced by too many factors beyond your social connections and we wouldn't be able to provide the user with actionable insights that outperform simple reflection. However, improving connection quality and frequency is totally within Fabriq's domain.

We aim to help users recognize a pattern between prioritizing their social lives and experiencing higher quality connections. This forms a positive feedback loop, where connecting with friends and family leads to higher quality connections, motivating people to connect more. The key behavior of the app, connecting with contacts, is self-reinforcing. 

We'll also be providing the user with suggestions in response to their trends and individual connections. We want the user to either have high connection quality/high frequency (more extroverted tendencies) or to be satisfied with high connection quality/low frequency (more introverted tendencies). If the user reports low connection quality, we can provide them with content that will help them form deeper connections with people. When they have a lower frequency than they would like, we'll help them increase the frequency either through adding more contacts or increasing their connections with existing contacts.

I would not have been able to support Fabriq's thinking on mood journals if I were not hyper learning.


## Examples of Hyper Learning

At the time of writing, I've worked on onboarding for five apps. While each app had unique onboarding problems, some of the most interesting learnings come from when I applied variations of the same idea in multiple instances.

## Benefits of Hyper Learning
I'm rarely working on a new problem from a blank slate.

## In the intro after the second paragraph
In the last two years, I've worked on onboarding for five different apps. Each app has their own unique problems for onboarding, but my experience with the others allowed me to start my work from a place of understanding. When I notice two apps have the same onboarding problems, I'm able to apply the same solution with contextual modifications from the first app to the second. Figuring out what those contextual modifications are prompts me to reflect more deeply on the mechanisms driving an idea's effectiveness.

Three of my clients use mood journals within their apps. Three use data visualization as a motivator. I've worked on five different onboarding experiences (*see [[Parameters of onboarding]]*. I've seen similar problems repeated time and time again, like [[Adoption requires a baseline of user involvement in order to overcome inertia]] and churn because the company did not [[Intentionally design for failure states]] or [[Difficulty Matching]]. Because of my varied experience, I am able to recognize problems that I've already solved, consult my past experience, compare the the details of those situations to my present situation, and generate better ideas.
