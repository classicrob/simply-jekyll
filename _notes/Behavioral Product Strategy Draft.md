[[Behavioral Product Strategy]] 





--
Old Version:
Behavioral Product Strategy is making better product decisions through the lenses of user psychology and behavioral influence. It is implicit in every app, and can't be ignored. This is because [[Every app is designed for behavior change, intentionally or unintentionally]].

When executed well, people will use the product in the best ways possible to deliver meaningful value to themselves and to the company. For this reason, [[I design for successful goal achievement and playstyles that are appropriate for the user]].

Behavioral product strategy encompasses product design, messaging, and company decision making processes. My specialty is in product design, but my work rarely stays perfectly siloed. How people behave and interpret the world is important when you want to make something people want to use, which has to happen because [[Products are fundamentally voluntary]]. People's default state of being is not using your product, and they need to deliberately overcome their default behaviors in order for your product to be adopted. 

A product's value can't be delivered unilaterally by the product to its users. The user needs to behave in certain ways appropriately..

With behavioral product strategy, you can [[Satisfy the social contract between the user and the app]] and improve [[User Involvement]].

The success of the app in a user's life is defined by whether they are able to accomplish their goals through your service. In order for a person to be successful in accomplishing goals where they had previously failed, apps need to facilitate and empower the user in behaving differently than they were before. **People need to use your app in a way that allows the app to be valuable.**

Here's where behavioral science proves its worth for product decisions. By understanding users and their behavior through these lenses, we are able to better understand them

According to [[Kurt Lewinâ€™s Equation]], people's behavior is determined by the relationship between who they are and the context they are within. Through behavioral product strategy, we are able to:
* Shape the context of the app through its design to influence user behavior
* Understand the context of the user's nature and life to better shape the app

Decisions made about a product need to come through the lenses of how users will interpret your decisions and how their behavior will be shaped by your decisions.

[[Products are fundamentally voluntary]]. Nobody is being forced to use your product. In fact, not using your product is their default set of habits, which people need to overcome through voluntary effort.
