## Positive feedback loops are self-reinforcing
### Exercise
When you lift weights you gain muscle, and gaining muscle lets you lift heavier weights. The process of working out helps you to gain more muscle (reward), which allows you to work out more and gain even more muscle. This sort of reward cycle is also known as a [positive feedback loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4kbJObhcHw)[["Feedback loops are systems where the output is fed back into the system as an input. And when it comes to game design, this typically means that a player’s success or failure impacts the likelihood of future successes and failures." Mark Brown::rsn]], where the reward enables you to do more of the action that earns you the reward.

If working out ten minutes a day got you the same results as working out an hour a day, which would you do? You’d probably pick ten minutes. Later, when someone asks you why you aren’t doing longer workouts, you’d give them a quizzical look and say, “Why the hell would I?”

Now imagine you just did an hour long spin class, you leave dripping in sweat and exhausted, and someone informs you after the fact: "New scientific evidence shows that people who work out 10 minutes a day and people who work out an hour a day burn the same amount of calories[[This is not actually true, of course. Just imagine it were.::lsn]]. I don’t know about you, but unless I just really enjoyed sitting on a bike going nowhere with pounding electronic remixes of “What a Wonderful World” in the background, I’d feel like a total sucker, and leave the next class after ten minutes.

Positive feedback loops incentivize people to increase the frequency of a [[User Goal]] oriented behavior as much as is possible to increase the frequency of goal achievement. This leads to an ever-increasing reward.
