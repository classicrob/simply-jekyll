"OpenMind is a psychology-based educational platform designed to depolarize campuses, companies, organizations, and communities. OpenMind helps people foster intellectual humility and mutual understanding, while equipping them with essential skills to engage constructively across differences."

[The team](https://openmindplatform.org/team/) is led by Jonathan Haidt and Caroline Mehl. Caroline had this to say about building OpenMind in [[GuidedTrack]]:

"GuidedTrack is a transformative tool for early-stage ventures! It allows you to build custom apps in a fraction of the typical time and cost. It's perfect for quickly prototyping and iterating new products. I think of it as the WordPress for apps â€“ you no longer need any coding experience to build your own apps. I highly recommend it!"
