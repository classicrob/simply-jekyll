[[Products are fundamentally voluntary]], and Expectancy Value Theory gives us a way to understand which goals people will pursue and what makes them more likely to be successful. This theory is one of the most straightforward ways to [[Make an experience the user wants]].

Translated into app terms:
	* [[The user believes that they are capable of performing actions within the app]]  
	* [[The user believes that their actions in the app lead to goal achievement]]
	* [[The user believes that the app will help them achieve a goal that they actually have]]
