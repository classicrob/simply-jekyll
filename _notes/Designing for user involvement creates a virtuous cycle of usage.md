title: Designing for user involvement creates a virtuous cycle of usage
---
Once we’ve set the behaviors involved in enhancing [[User Involvement]] in motion, we create a virtuous cycle of involvement.  This is because the user’s positive behaviors lead to increasing involvement while their increased involvement motivates them to do more of the positive behaviors that lead to increasing user involvement. People internalize the value of the app more deeply over time, so [[Designing for user involvement has positive effects on conversion, retention, and virality]].
