## The emotional experience of Flow

A **flow state** is often characterized as optimal human experience.  It’s an experience where you are fully focused and energized in what you’re doing, often experiencing a high level of creativity and losing track of time.

The general emotional experience that is being described here is that when a task is too challenging for a user’s current level of ability, they’ll get frustrated and give up. Alternatively, when the task is far too easy, they are likely to experience boredom. Both of these are potential [[Intentionally design for failure states]]s where the user may lose interest in the app. 

**As a rule of thumb, I find it best to match the difficulty of the task with the skill level of the user.**

The model feels, in a sense, incomplete. I argue that difficulty matching in conjunction with [[Goal Resonance]] that produces positive emotions in users.

## Difficulty matching in [[Adoption]]

[[People start using an app with different prior skill levels]]. Somebody might start to learn how to use an app and they pick up on it quickly because they have a high prior skill. On the flip side, other users might not get it immediately.

If I can only provide value at one skill level, then users at that skill level are the only ones I can count on sticking around.

Duolingo gives you a **placement test** at the beginning of your experience that allows you to skip a good amount of content. This is useful so that people like me who come in already knowing a good amount of Spanish don't get bored being forced to review how to say "boy" or "girl" before we get to the content that's actually interesting to us.

An alternative approach might be starting the user off with simple tasks and, based on their performance, you can escalate, de-escalate, or maintain difficulty level for the next task. In game design, this is referred to as **Dynamic difficulty.** Resident Evil 4 does this, where if you are fighting zombies and dying frequently, they'll give you less zombies with less strength. Alternatively, if you're constantly successful, they'll present you with a greater challenge.

## Difficulty matching in continued user involvement (retention)

[[Apps with continued user involvement are responsive to increasing skill levels over time]]

## Difficulty matching in push notifications
*My thoughts on this sort of mesh difficulty matching with the [[Fogg Behavior Model]].*

A push notification is essentially an ask. Whenever a user receives a push notification, they are being asked to do something. Additionally, push notifications are ephemeral. If users receive a push notification and they don't respond to it immediately, then it will generally fade into the background and be forgotten.

If what users are being asked to do is too challenging to do in the present moment or they simply don't care enough, then they won't do it and it will be forgotten. If this happens too often, then the user may fall into the habit of ignoring push notification.

The app doesn't know what is going on in the lives of the user in the moments when they send a notification, so if there is only one behavioral response to that notification, then the app is betting on serendipity.

One possible solution is to simply do low-effort asks, but this may lead to the user getting bored. Another possible solution is to give the user multiple possible responses to a notification that account for varying levels of motivation, skill, and ability

An example of this is how some email apps allow you to snooze an email to return to your inbox later as a possible response to seeing the email. This is to account for the difficulty of the ask (respond to an email) being too high for your current level of motivation and ability.
