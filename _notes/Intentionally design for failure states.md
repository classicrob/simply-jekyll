title: Intentionally design for failure states

#stub 

A failure state is when users fail to reach their goal in some way. In goal achievement, failure states are inevitable, because a goal is by definition a discrepancy between your desired state of reality and your present state. If we didn't have failure states, the intention-behavior gap [[There tends to be a gap between what people intend to do and what they actually do::rmn]] would be a non-issue (rather than one of the hardest problems in the world to solve). Before people start using your app, they probably tried to do it unsuccessfully in some other way.

Some potential causes of user failure include:
* Lack of knowledge
* Obstacles in real life
* Struggle to pick up where they left off
* Usability obstacles
* Forgetfulness
* Too challenging
* Lack of belief in themselves
* Something isn't there that should be

Many apps ignore failure states and have no plan for when they happen. However, games intentionally design for failure because they recognize they have no other choice - otherwise people would stop playing as soon as they mess up. Additionally, they deal with it in many different ways.

### Failure Redemption in Hollow Knight

In [[Hollow Knight]], they wanted to make a challenging game because they wanted players to feel the accomplishment of beating something that previously beat them. 

So you’re exploring around this map, killing monsters, earning money. When you die, you lose all of your money, and go back to your last checkpoint.

Sounds super demotivating, right?  Well, the same thing is basically happening in a [[streak counter]].  You work up days in a row, and then upon failure, you have to start over again.  Sound similar in structure?

**Hollow Knight** does something clever to deal with this.  When you die, you leave a “shade” where you died, lose all of your money, and go back to your last checkpoint.  In order to get all of your money back, you need to get to the shade and beat it.  If you die again before then, then you lose all the money for good.

Hollow Knight's designers wanted players to try again after failing. In order to encourage that behavior, they gave players something to lose from failing and a chance to regain it all from trying again to get to the point where they lost everything. This allowed the designers to use loss aversion / the endowment effect for motivating the player while they were successful and for restarting when they failed.
