title: When is gamification appropriate?
---
[[Gamification is not one monolithic thing]], so asking when it is appropriate is like asking  when design is appropriate. To me, it's really an exploration of the fact that [[Game designers and behavioral scientists are asking many of the same questions]]. It's about taking inspiration from game design and behavioral science to influence voluntary user behavior.

[[Every app is designed for behavior change, intentionally or unintentionally]]. From an ethical perspective, I'm just trying to make sure that I'm intentional about helping the user to close the [[Intention-Behavior Gap]]. 

If I know their intention and current behavior, I can influence them to make them more likely to close the gap. If I don't know their intention, then I can design the choice architecture so users reveal their intentions to me. Once I know those intentions, I can influence them to increase their odds of success.

So I'm not sure if there is a time when I'm not at least considering principles of behavioral influence in the design, whether I'm guiding behavior or listening to intentions.
