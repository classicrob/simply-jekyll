title: The most successful app adoptions come from a project

[[New users do not yet have the vocabulary to understand the app]]. A big mistake that many people make when they try out a new app is that they’ll try to understand features in a very abstract sense. **They will try to understand what it is without knowing what it is for.** When people make this mistake, [[Adoption]] goes down. Projects allow the app to [[Speak to the user with a shared vocabulary]]. 

This is exactly what happened with Francesco D’Alessio from Keep Productive (sorry for the roast buddy but this is what happened 🙂️) when he tried to do a [“first impressions” video on Roam,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TuOwKpk0jA) having made 10 dummy pages that weren’t useful towards any project. He tried understanding a novel app without context, so he wasn’t communicating effectively with the app.

In order to have a successful onboarding experience, you don’t need to learn every feature. [[The user should learn enough of the app’s functionality to accomplish a goal]]. However, it’s still helpful to be aware of what features you have available to you so you can recognize the situations where you’ll need to learn it. [[Help the user to recognize situations for app usage]].
