One of the companies I work with, GuidedTrack, is a simplified programming language that allows subject matter experts to create web applications with no prior coding skill. However, if someone starts using it and they’ve already coded before in another language, then we can probably treat them differently in the onboarding. If we don’t, then they’ll likely get bored.

The principle of [[Difficulty Matching]] says that it’s important would say that it’s important to make sure those with a higher prior skill level are given a higher challenge.

Duolingo is a language learning app, and at the beginning of your experience, they ask you whether you are a beginner or if you have some experience with the language. If so, you are given a placement test that allows you to skip some of the earlier learning modules.
