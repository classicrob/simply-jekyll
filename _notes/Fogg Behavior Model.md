- This model isn't based on experimental evidence, but is rather a bunch of formalized common-sense assumptions. Use it as a set of rules of thumb that are generally good to follow and don't pretend like it's all the psych you need to make a good product and you'll be fine.
- Not much scientific evidence behind this model specifically, but seems like it’s essentially a formalization of [[Friction and Fuel]]/[[3Bs]], positive pressures/negative pressures, etc. with some common sense assumptions built in. they’re all saying more or less the same thing- cost/benefit!
- Using it well- don’t assume this is all that you need to know about behavioral science to make a good product. This is essentially formalized common-sense.
    - Ability
        - "Make it simple, remove steps.  This is what UX designers do best."
        - Does the user have the necessary skills, energy, time, or other resources to do some behavior? Has the user built up the necessary amount of [[self-efficacy]]?
    - Motivation:
        - This is the part where UX designers tend to struggle.
        - Self-efficacy is one way to boost motivation
- Implications of the model
    - If motivation is higher than ability when the user is prompted, they will do the behavior.
        - I’d rephrase this as if motivation is higher than ability when the user is prompted, they are more likely to do the behavior than if not.
    - diminishing marginal returns: 
        - If ability is already high, then making things a little easier will not make as much difference in the frequency of the behavior as increasing motivation
        - if motivation is already high, making it a little more motivating will not make as much difference as increasing ability and making it easier.
    - Motivation goes up and down in waves, as he refers to in [[motivation waves]] and motivation is harder to increase than ability.
        - This means:
            - We should make things as low friction as possible in order to make our prompts more successful.
            - If a user is experiencing high motivation, prompting them to do something easy is a waste.
        - try to do [[motivation check]]s in order to give people the right activities at the right moment.
