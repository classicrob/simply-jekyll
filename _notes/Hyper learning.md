title: Hyper learning

Hyper learning is a coinage for connecting the dots across multiple projects or fields to facilitate a deeper understanding of the world. It is fundamentally interdisciplinary thinking, and it generally happens at a quicker pace than normal learning by nature of more fully leveraging past experience.

An effective hyper learner intentionally places themselves into positions where there are more dots to connect and considers reflection a core part of their work. This is why I consult and take note writing seriously-- gather varied experiences and integrate them.

I didn't always know I was a hyper learner. In college, I launched my first startup. It took a year of my time and thousands of dollars to realize that it wasn't where I would make my impact. I was working on all aspects of the business, and much of my time was spent in roles that I wasn't capable of filling.

About a month before I decided to pull the plug, I met [Whitney Robinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitneyrobinson/) at a design conference. She told me, "...Around age 30, I realized that execution was not my greatest skill, so I decided not to focus on that." My jaw dropped.

Some people have guffawed at this when I told them this story. They hold the belief that everybody has to be able to execute in order to be successful. But what if different people had relative advantages in different skills? What if they devoted all of their energy towards their zones of genius and collaborated to create a sum that couldn't be achieved by devoting energy to areas where others could perform significantly better?

I took a step back to figure out what my skills were.

My skills lie in interdisciplinary thinking, framing problems to make them actionable, researching the right questions, applying behavioral science creatively to product problems, and iterating on dynamic feedback. I'm an excellent communicator and thought partner. What if I focused on my strengths, and found others with complimentary strengths? Hyper learning can come from combining the experiences of people who look at the world in different ways.

Being a hyper learner, I realized that my understanding of the world would increase at the fastest rate if I could work on a variety of projects simultaneously and sequentially. I intentionally became a consultant because I recognized that this would be the best incubator for my impact and intellectual growth. This is also one of the reasons [[Why I chose to consult rather than pursue a PhD]].

Hyper learning is the process through which I integrate what I learn from one project into what I'm working on with another project. When I solve a problem for one client, I attempt to conceptualize a more abstract form of the problem and solution, making applicable to more situations. This is a process I refer to as [[learning through going up and down the ladder of abstraction]]

Abstractions are the core building block of a hyper learner to integrate varied experience. By allowing my knowledge, ideas, and learnings to cross-pollinate across projects, my output grows rapidly stronger. Consulting allows me to make bets on ideas in multiple situations to understand their boundary conditions and generalizability.

Pausing for a second, let's do a thought experiment. Compare a person who works on one product for 2 years with someone who works on 10 products in the same time period. Who is more likely to accurately diagnose and solve problems they have never worked with directly before?

I have a career path that extends many decades ahead of me. My dream is to eventually run an organization that is part [[Startup Studio]], part consultancy, and part independent research lab. We will systematically [[Make an impact through portfolio effects]]. We will produce our own products, improve the probability of success for external products, and educate generations of applied behavioral science and product practitioners. Through individual and collaborative hyper learning, we will massively improve the likelihood that any of the ideas we implement are successful.
