My role as a consultant is not to deliver solutions to my client, but to deliver my client to solutions. 

This is my response to a core consulting question: how do we mix my general domain knowledge with your specific domain knowledge of your company & customers?

I don't tell you what to do, I help you figure out what to do, informed by perspectives and lenses you didn't have access to before. I'll give suggestions, sure, but ultimately it's you who will know what the right answer is. I don't take, "just trust me on this one" lightly.

The point is not for my idea to win, but for my client to win. I want my client to think more effectively as a result of working with me. I want whatever ideas we go with to have as high of a likelihood of success as possible

As a consultant, being able to say, “here’s my suggestion, but really it’s just an implementation of these core ideas” has been a super helpful skill. This allows me to adjust & simplify on the fly according to my client’s intuitions while maintaining what makes it work.

Note: being able to do this requires that your ideas are the result of solid diagnosis and theory in ways that you can pinpoint. This enforces some rigor in ideation that improves your output and enables iteration. Read between your own lines.

One of my clients, Oliver Sauter, mentioned: "In our sessions it created a nice flow dynamic because of that. Surfacing high quality summaries of those ideas helped to make them available in my ad-hoc thinking and contextualise your suggestions. This way I could better contribute to finding solutions.""

### Persuasion

I used to get frustrated when my clients wouldn't use my ideas. Eventually I just realized that I wasn't putting enough serious thought into persuasive approaches. Clients have their own sets of mental models that need to be worked within and around to be convinced. 

#### Methods

Break it down to principles. "Different people come to your app with different goals" and "Different people have different prior skill levels." People usually don't disagree with that. My rec of what to do with that information is then better received.

Take [[Speak to the user with a shared vocabulary]] - it's really hard to disagree with any of this. 

Establish a framework for evaluating success. "We want to go with an idea that does \_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_." If they agree on the scorecard, my ideas are better received because I designed them with that evaluation in mind and they are being evaluated through a similar lens.

At the same time, persuasion should only be the goal if, after hearing alternate perspectives, I'm still convinced I'm right. Being open to critique and understanding my ideas well enough that I know what's core and can be repurposed is helpful.

Similarly, establishing a common understanding of our scorecard and the facts that should inform our ideas means that even if we don't go with my idea, we'll still come to a good conclusion. As a consultant, I care less about my ego and more about facilitating successful outcomes

So at it's core, my main persuasive approach is to find the areas where we agree and build out from there. This creates a win-win from finding further agreement.
