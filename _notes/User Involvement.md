**definition:** User involvement is defined by the behaviors that the user needs to do in order to make the product valuable to themselves. With high quality user involvement, people are using your product when their lives call for it and in a way that allows the product to fulfill its promise to the user.

With high user involvement, you’ve won over your user. They stay loyal to you for longer, they buy your new products, and they speak highly of you to their friends and contacts. This is sustainable because you have found the way you fit into your user’s lives. Increased [[Adoption]], [[Retention]], and [[Virality]] are natural byproducts as the user has fully internalized your product’s value as playing a role in their lives.

It’s important to [[Satisfy the social contract between the user and the app]], and if a user is involved, that means that they are playing their role in the agreement.
