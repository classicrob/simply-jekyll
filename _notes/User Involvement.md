Imagine purchasing a gym membership in order to lose weight or grow more muscular. Having a gym membership is not enough on its own! Person A trying to lose weight should perhaps use the cardio machines frequently, and Person B trying to gain muscle would benefit most from using a variety of the available equipment or hiring a personal trainer. Success for each person is determined by the gym **and** their behavior.

User involvement is defined by the set of behaviors that the user needs to enact in order to experience desirable outcomes. If the user is doing the behaviors that help them accomplish their goals using your product, then they have successfully been involved. The design of your product can influence the way users interact with it and their level of involvement.

Value can't be unilaterally delivered from the company to the user. The best apps can generally do is provide access to value. The user needs to take advantage of the opportunity and be **involved** in the co-creation of value, because only then will it be possible to [[Satisfy the social contract between the user and the app]].

With high user involvement, you’ve won over your user. They stay loyal to you for longer, they buy your new products, and they speak highly of you to their friends and contacts. This is sustainable because you have found the way you fit into your user’s lives. With high quality user involvement, people are using your product when their lives call for it, allowing the product to be fully valuable. [[Designing for user involvement has positive effects on conversion, retention, and virality]].
