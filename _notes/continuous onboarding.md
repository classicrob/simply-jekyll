title: continuous onboarding
---
**definition:** Continuous onboarding is an onboarding that never stops.  Users are constantly being shown how to be better at using the app in an attempt to increase [[User Involvement]].

Because of [[The hard problem of onboarding horizontal products]], a single, upfront onboarding will not be enough. [[Adoption requires a baseline of user involvement in order to overcome inertia]], but [[Apps with continued user involvement are responsive to increasing skill levels over time]]. In an ideal world, the user is continuously improving their skills and learning how to use it better.

[[Continuous onboarding can come from the community]]
