[[Horizontal product|Horizontal products]] like Notion, Airtable, Excel, and Obsidian are all powerful/flexible and require learning and expansion of use cases over time to wrap your head around them. Given that, why do they only teach people how to use the app for the first few minutes?

It's not just horizontal products though. Continuous Onboarding applies to most apps that aren't just "open, press a button, and close." Are you continuing to add features over time that would benefit users that are more than a month into their journey? How are users going to find those features and mentally connect them to greater goal accomplishment? Other examples include Substack, calendars, email clients, PDF readers, etc.

[[User goals change over time]]. The goals that users have six days in are going to be different than the goals they have 6 months in, so it needs to be the case that [[User skill level increases over time]] in order to match their changing goals. [[Apps with continued user involvement respond to changing user goals over time|Apps that are responsive to changing user goals over time foster continued user buy-in]], so it makes sense that the app should continuously teach people how to use its app better. Additionally, product teams will often add new features that expand the app's possible use cases, requiring the user to learn something new after they may have thought they were already done learning.

Continuous Onboarding never stops. As users accomplish more of their goals, their [[Self-efficacy]] goes up. They feel as though the effort they've invested was worthwhile. Through learnable design, their [[mental model|mental models]] align with how the app's, and things "just make sense." Both adoption and retention go up, allowing you to escape the Sisyphean cycle of acquisition and churn.

Continuous onboarding is explicitly designing an app to facilitate the user's growth from beginner to power user, recognizing that's not all going to happen in one day. Users feel heard and capable, so they stick around for longer.

It should be noted that some apps have a more expansive range of potential use cases than others. It may be the case that the user can learn your app in 10 minutes and then be done learning. The important thing to continuous onboarding is to think about [[Goal Resonance]]- how will a user discover that the app helps them accomplish a goal and execute the sets of behaviors that enable them to accomplish said goal? [[The user may have a lack of imagination as to what user goals they can accomplish]], so how can we expand their conceptualization of the product's utility?

"Explainer content" (documentation, app tours, videos, etc.) is valuable, but isn’t scalable. Most people ignore explainer content. Learnable design, on the other hand, means that, as the user attempts to do something, the app [[Feedback loops are a more efficient method of communication|communicates how it works through feedback loops]]. Make the impact of the user's actions more clear and immediate, while signaling how it brings the user closer to or further from their goals. Pay attention to the user's choices, and based on those, connect users to the functionality that matches their intention.
