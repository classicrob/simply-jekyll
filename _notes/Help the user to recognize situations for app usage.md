[[User goals change over time]] as [[User skill level increases over time]] so being aware of the features generally means youâ€™ll be aware of when you should learn it to accomplish a new goal.

Due to principles of [[Difficulty Matching]], we know that if we ask a user to learn something too advanced early in, they will likely get frustrated and give up. This is a common problem with Notion and Roam users: they see people using the applications in advanced ways near the beginning of their experience and they think that they have to implement everything right from the start.

These users would have far better outcomes if they simply operated at or slightly above their skill level to accomplish their current goals, but were aware of what could help them accomplish their future goals so they know what they can learn *when those goals arise.*
