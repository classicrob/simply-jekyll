[[Interventions in apps need to be desirable, whereas interventions in experiments do not]]. A user needs to self-select into receiving an intervention by using some feature in order for us to know whether the intervention will actually work.

If we design choices so each option is meaningful, they simply represent different interests and [[playstyle]]s, then the user's selection is revealing. This is why I often start client engagements with a workshop where we [[Use a badging system as a method of actionable user research]]. It's important to think about badges less as "motivators" and more as goalposts that [[Speak to the user with a shared vocabulary]] about what they want, and the requirements to earn the badges should mirror the behaviors that are necessary to achieve a user goal within your app. If this is the case, then which badges users pursue and their progress towards those badges gives you a necessary prerequisite to understanding [[User Involvement]] and how to influence it.

### Borderlands 2 strategically sets up player decisions through its systems

At the beginning of the game, they ask you to pick a class of character to play as, where you have 6 options and each has their own strengths and weaknesses. The sniper class may be good for someone who likes to play it safe, whereas the psycho class may be good for someone who enjoys a high risk - high reward playstyle.

While you're playing the game, you have three different skill trees that all reward different playstyles. Earning the most powerful skills in any particular tree requires you to earn more basic skills first from within that tree. Again, player choices reveal what the player cares about.
