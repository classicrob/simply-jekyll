I want to just freewrite for a bit.

So one, I think that it would be possible to set up Obsidian alongside the terminal, filters, and nested header inheritance (from [[Murf]]) such that it would be better for me than Roam. There would absolutely be some growing pains, but I could do it.

I want to make a new GIF for side-by-side preview to put on my website, and I also want to spend a bit of time making pages for each specific component of the onboarding so that I am able to reference more easily from here.
