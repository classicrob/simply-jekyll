**In order to successfully onboard a horizontal product, we need to deliver an experience that is initially meaningful to groups of people who understand and care about different things.**

[[There are individual differences between new users in their initial user goals]] and [[People start using an app with different prior skill levels]]. This makes it difficult to [[Speak to the user with a shared vocabulary]] because there is no single user group.

This points towards the need for an intentional approach to individual differences. [[I design for successful goal achievement and playstyles that are appropriate for the user]].

**In order to successfully onboard a horizontal product, we need to increase their skill over time to keep up with their changing goals.**

[[New users do not yet have the vocabulary to understand the app]], but as [[User skill level increases over time]], so does their vocabulary. They are able to conceptualize and express desires that they couldnâ€™t express before, so [[User goals change over time]].

This points towards the need for a [[Continuous onboarding]] that progressively reveals information as the user develops so they are always becoming more effective users.
