I loosely define gamification as taking inspiration from game design and behavioral science to influence voluntary user behavior. [[Game designers and behavioral scientists are asking many of the same questions]], it's just that the game designers may not use the same vocabulary or methods for validating ideas. As such, I look to game design as an alternate set of lenses for studying and drawing inspiration for [[Behavioral Product Strategy]].

Other definitions focus too much on mechanics or elements, which ends up leading to the fact that [[Most gamification sucks]] and, from my perspective, misses the point. Most people think about gamification as points, badges, and leaderboards. I say that [[Gamification is not one monolithic thing]]. In fact, it is a whole domain of study and practice. [[There could be many genres of gamification]] beyond the "Foursquare genre."
