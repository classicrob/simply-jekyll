I loosely define gamification as taking inspiration from game design and behavioral science to voluntarily influence user behavior. Whether an idea is attributed to game designers or behavioral scientists is secondary to me, as the thinking of the two groups is often parallel and can be so deeply interwoven that this attribution sometimes feels pointless. [[Game designers and behavioral scientists are asking many of the same questions]].

Other definitions focus too much on mechanics or elements, which ends up leading to [[Lazy gamification]] and, from my point of view, misses the point. 

To explore my thoughts on gamification, the best place to start is on [[Most gamification sucks]], where you will be able to branch out and find thoughts on how to make it better.
