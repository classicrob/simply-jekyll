title: User Goal
---
[[There are individual differences between new users in their initial user goals]], which plays a crucial role in the [[Parameters of onboarding]]. Since [[Adoption requires a baseline of user involvement in order to overcome inertia]], the user must see how the app relates to their ability to accomplish goals quickly.

Additionally, [[User goals change over time]], so if we want [[Retention]], we need continued [[User Involvement]].

Goals that matter to the user are ones they were struggling to accomplish on their own with alternative solutions. This means that failure is inevitable. [[Intentionally design for failure states]] so users try again rather than give up. Reduce the likelihood of failure states from occurring by actively [[Difficulty Matching]] in the [[User Involvement]] you require.
