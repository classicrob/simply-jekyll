# Old:

I'm Rob Haisfield, CEO of [[Behavioral Product Strategy]] and [[Gamification]] consultancy [Influence Insights](https://www.influenceinsights.io/). I'm also a behavioral product strategist at startup studio [Spark Wave](https://www.sparkwave.tech/), where I do the same thing as I do in my consulting except I do it for portfolio companies.

Generally speaking, this means that study behavioral science / game design deeply in order to apply the principles of each to make products people love. This is all with the aim of enabling users to better accomplish their goals. I begin to discuss ideas related to this in my pages on [[User Involvement]] and [[Behavioral Product Strategy]].

I got into this world out of a deep passion and curiosity for learning about why people do what they do. This feels to me as though one of the largest possible ways that I can [[Make an impact through portfolio effects]]. 

Behavioral product strategy is a new field that has incredible potential and much remaining to discover. Gamification, in concept, is incredibly powerful, but has been systematically misunderstood and misapplied since its beginning. [[Gamification is not one monolithic thing]], but it has been treated as such for far too long. This website is meant to be a public space for me to explore my thoughts and experience in each of these domains of study.

I'm [[Writing in hypertext]], which may produce a different reading experience from what you're used to finding online. **Think of it like a book that rearranges its pages and paragraphs for you based on your interest where all you need to do is click on whatever link sounds most appealing from a page.** However, this is just as new of a medium for me as it is for you! I have dozens of pages of content to manage at various stages of idea development. Expect this site to be different the next time you see it because I'm updating it constantly. 

Please contact me if you see typos, if there's a stub page you want me to expand upon, or if you have related thoughts to anything that you read in here! @RobertHaisfield on Twitter and rob@influenceinsights.io to email me

## New notes about Emacs

What does self-documenting mean?

* " “Self-documenting” means that at any time you can use special
commands, known as “help commands”, to find out what your options are,
or to find out what any command does, or to find all the commands that
pertain to a given topic.  *Note Help::."

I think that means something to do with everything you need is contextually available 

## New draft

Hi, I'm Rob Haisfield. I'm currently open to opportunities, whether it's in product, consulting, or research. I am particularly keen on opportunities that pertain to [Scaling Synthesis](https://scalingsynthesis.com/), my research project on how to build software that enables people to think better with large quantities of information and scales of collaboration.

I was formerly a product manager for Tana, but [now serve as an advisor](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1617626238457384960?s=20). Previously, I performed research on [Scaling Synthesis](https://scalingsynthesis.com/) (viewable in [video format here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRYIUDRwWg) ).

Before that, I was an independent [[Behavioral Product Strategy]] and [[Gamification]] consultant. Much of this website was written at that point in time, so should be viewed in that context. [[Every app is designed for behavior change, intentionally or unintentionally]], and problems can generally be boiled down to "people are behaving differently than we hoped." **I empower you and your team to be intentional about how you shape your product to influence user behaviors.**

**All you need to do is click on what is interesting.** This is a special trait of this website - by [[Writing in hypertext]], it is structured for both you and I to explore my thoughts. In a linear piece of writing, all ideas would be sequenced into one narrative. In my hypertext writing, the narrative is emergent and the ideas are associative.

This website is an open notebook. The purpose of this is to share the ideas that I'm exploring and to think in public. This means that, unlike a traditional blog, I'm showcasing many ideas that are in development rather than complete. If you'd like to see more detail or have related thoughts, feel free to leave a comment or tweet at me [@RobertHaisfield](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield). For other conversation, [hello@robhaisfield.com](mailto:hello@robhaisfield.com).

### Intro page

Welcome to my hypertext notebook. I've found hypertext as a medium to be incredibly liberating, and come with unique affordances. See [[Writing in hypertext]] for a primer on how to best consume this website. The majority of this website was written while I was working as a behavioral product strategy and gamification consultant, and has seen minimal updates since then. It discusses topics such as:
- [[Behavioral Product Strategy]]
	- [[User Involvement]]
	- [[Designing for user involvement has positive effects on adoption, retention, and virality]]
- Gamification
	- [[Intentionally design for failure states]]
	- [[Difficulty Matching]]
	- [[Most gamification sucks]]
- Onboarding
	- [[The hard problem of onboarding horizontal products]]
	- [[Continuous onboarding]]
	- [[Initial Plan for GuidedTrack Onboarding]] (case study)
- End-user Programming
	- [[Domain-specific languages as end-user software]]
	- [[End-user scripting enables creative workarounds]]
- How I tend to work with clients
	- [[How we can work together]]
	- [[Use a badging system as a method of actionable user research]]
- My personal journey
	- [[Why I chose to consult rather than pursue a PhD]]
	- [[Hyper learning]]
	- [[About Me]]

### Bio

I started out studying behavioral economics in college, graduated wanting to keep working in the space but figured that technology was the best place to apply behavioral science for high impact.

And I figured that I could continue to learn about behavioral science by reading papers on my own and working with products to apply the insights and see them in action. I ended up mostly working on adoption and retention for apps, through the lens of User Involvement.

For three years, I worked as an independent consultant specializing in behavioral product strategy and gamification. Through product design, I influence user behavior such that users successfully accomplish their goals. At the same time, I worked as the behavioral product strategist for a startup foundry called Spark Wave, doing similar work with their portfolio companies (most notably, GuidedTrack). Over the course of working with over a dozen startups, I repeatedly engaged with onboarding and retention challenges.

-   All throughout the process, I was using tools for thought, especially these hypertext tools.

-   When I was consulting I would work on multiple projects at once, taking in information from different sources, including papers, meetings, user interviews, Twitter, as well as research from different domains, like behavioral science, game design, and UX. These hypertext graph based tools really helped me make sense of everything and continue to learn from it over the course of a whole career.
-   I've used Bear, Notion, Roam, Obsidian, and Tana seriously at this point, for between 6-18 months each. I'm passionate about networked tools for thought because they have been a work requirement and enabler for me. Over the course of the last few years, I've built up a following of passionate software users.
-   August 2021-March 2022, I received a research grant from The Graph Foundation alongside Joel Chan and Brendan Langen to scale synthesis, by researching design affordances and principles for note taking and thought processing software. We surveyed the prior art and interviewed 40 users and builders of tools for thought and wrote about what we learned in a hypertext notebook entitled Scaling Synthesis.
-   In August 2022 I began work for Tana, a 5th generation tool for thought geared towards advanced relationships, gradual structure, and end-user programming. If you've followed me on Twitter or read Scaling Synthesis, you'll know that's my jam.
-   I'm passionate about building software that enables people to synthesize information more effectively. Every app is designed for behavior change in some way, and the only way to be responsible about it is to be intentional about the design. The choice architecture should enable the user to tell the app what they want, but there should also be a way for the app to teach
-   I focus on designing software that helps people to think and be better. In order to do that, I design apps to influence user behavior in a goal-aligned way. Goal achievement increases
