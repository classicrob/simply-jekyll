title: There is no curriculum of everything you should know
---
People often ask me what they need to read in order to do [[Behavioral Product Strategy]]. My answer? **There is no curriculum of everything you should know.**

### I’ve found the following useful:
* Behavioral economics helps me to understand how people make decisions and judgements around concepts of v	alue
* The study of individual differences and personality helps me to understand users better, how to interpret that information better, and how to translate that into behavior change
* The study of the psychology of self-regulation helps me to understand how people set, strive for, and achieve (or fail to achieve) their [[User Goal]]s.  This is useful in messaging, in [[Gamification]], in [[Behavioral Product Strategy]], and more.
* The study of game design shows me a million and one ways that real designers have attempted to influence people’s behavior through a digital design. The thing to remember is that [[Game designers have been designing for digital behavior change for longer than just about anyone]]
### Other practitioners have found the following useful (though I’ve barely stuck my toes in):
* The psychology of emotions
* Neuroscience
* Evolutionary psychology
* Cultural psychology

### People are incredibly complex, so it would be impossible to say “This is all you need to know about people.” 
**I would even struggle to say “here’s the minimum that you need to know,” other than it’s probably more than you think.** The study of people is so broad in nature and there’s so much that can be useful within it to the people who are able to apply conceptual knowledge, that you might as well just [[follow curiosity unconditionally]]. It’ll be more enjoyable.

Even if there were a curriculum, then [[If I read what everybody else is reading, then I’ll think like everybody else]].
