People in the internet circles I operate within talk a lot about having a conversation with their notes (*I'm looking at you, Zettelkasten weirdos*). I wanted to show you what this looks like!

Right now, many of you may know that I've been working on the GuidedTrack onboarding. Participating in product communities for [[Roam]] and [[Obsidian]] has really shown me just how impactful they can be for the new user experience. 

Seriously, imagine you're thrown into a product that operates under totally different mental models than you're used to using. You can tell the product is powerful, but you also know you're going to need to invest some effort into learning and practice. You're definitely going to mess up a bit along the way, and you're not sure if you can do it. Wouldn't it comforting to have a supportive group of people that are there to help you out?

[[New users do not yet have the vocabulary to understand the app]]. A community can help people to formulate and answer their questions, with user-to-user support that outpaces what an early stage team could provide.

A community can be a location to forge friendships and collaborations between members. It can be a location to submit bug reports and feature requests, enabling users to form a relationship with the developers.

**Anyway, this is a note to show a process. So here we go-**

### I track my open questions and then ask my notes for an answer

**TL;DR, here's what I do:**
1. I think out loud in Roam, and I capture thoughts that occurred elsewhere.
2. Along the way, I'll track my open questions. These become a core organizational layer for my notes
3. When I'm working on a project, I query for open questions related to that project.
4. I pick the open question I'm most interested in and translate it into a query, I indent under it a block reference to the question. A block is indented under that tagged with "Saved View." Then I find a spot under the 
5. I block reference the open question again on another node along with any page references that make sense to include at the top level, and write my new thoughts there, block referencing as I go.
6. I write and find supporting thoughts as a very fast back and forth between writing new thoughts and developing old thoughts with their original context as reference material.

## 1. Think out loud, capture everything
## 2. Track open questions
## 3. Find relevant open questions
## 4. Translate the open question into a query, find a spot to record your thoughts

Here are a couple of examples: High velocity of interaction and where do we host the community

## 5. Write with the input of a conversation partner considering your question
## 6. 


## Misc
You may notice how I have block references under the attribute for Requirements.  I could have made the choice to embed the block for requirements there instead, but these are new thoughts so it makes sense to mix it in with just the important parts of the former requirements thread.

So I'm block referencing in the stuff that's useful from prior outlines to proliferate what's important through time, and I'm weaving it in with my new thoughts.

At the end, I have one page that I can filter of all of my most important thoughts related to the project of developing a GuidedTrack community plan that mixes well with the Slack community plan.
