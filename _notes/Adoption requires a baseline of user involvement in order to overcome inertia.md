[[Products are fundamentally voluntary]] and your product takes effort to use. [[Speak to the user with a shared vocabulary]] so they are able to understand why you are worthwhile.

Design the user’s initial experience so the user makes that agreement with the product and so that both parties hold up their end of the bargain.
