Make changes to the product with questions in mind

# [[Products are fundamentally voluntary]]

## With B2C apps, people can choose whether they use it or not.

In fact, not using it is their default behavior, which you're trying to get them to switch from. According to Aline Holzwarth, one of[ the laws of behavior](https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/the-three-laws-of-human-behavior/) is that a behavior will continue along with the status quo unless friction is reduced or fuel is added.

Reducing friction can help, but it isn't the whole story. If I don't want to eat broccoli, it doesn't matter if you fill up my fridge with veggie and makes a chef available in my home to cook it for me.

**It doesn't matter if an app is easy to use if I don't want to use it.**

Adding fuel requires aligning with people's goals and tapping into the fuel that is already there. [[Expectancy Value Theory]] is a useful way to judge whether you are in alignment. Your product is in a very good position if you can:

* Show people that the app enables them accomplish goals they already had but were previously struggling with.
* Prove to people that they are capable of using the app to accomplish their goals.

## [[Interventions in apps need to be desirable, whereas interventions in academia do not]]

In a product, it doesn't matter if a feature improves retention if people won't use the feature. Since the user's volition is an inescapable component of a feature's efficacy, it is crucial to design for [[User Involvement]]. **A product or feature has to be able to attract users and influence user behavior to be considered effective.**

Academic research often pays or otherwise obligates their participants to use an intervention. Their results show whether their intervention is effective given that people use it because that's all they need to show.

## Self-selection matters to products

Since people can choose whether they use the app, that means that 

## Applied behavioral scientists have to design interventions that influence the behavior of a specific population in a specific context

## Speed matters
The question of evidence is different from experiments. It's much faster.
