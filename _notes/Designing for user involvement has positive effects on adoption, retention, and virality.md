# [[Adoption]]
---
[[The most successful app adoptions come from a project]] because that gives users the motivation to learn functionalities in the context of when they are useful and persist through failures. [[Adoption requires a baseline of user involvement in order to overcome inertia]]. Designing for user involvement allows you to [[Speak to the user with a shared vocabulary]]. People design their own experience in an app through their actions, so designing for [[User Involvement]] early on means that the user will be doing behaviors that help them realize the value of the app. As a result, they’ll be more willing to pay.

In these notes, I tend to use adoption, conversion, and onboarding not necessarily interchangeably, but in similar contexts.

# [[Retention]]
---
**User involvement and retention are so deeply intertwined that I think it’s best to reframe retention as “continued user involvement.”** User involvement is incredibly goal oriented, so as [[User goals change over time]], it must be the case that [[Apps with continued user involvement respond to changing user goals over time]]. 

I design for user involvement, not engagement. See: [[The difference between user involvement and user engagement]], where I talk about designing for how user involvement is an input metric for business and user goals. Focusing on user involvement aligns incentives.

# Virality
