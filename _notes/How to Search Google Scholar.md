If you see a paper that looks like it might be related to what you’re searching for:

Read the abstract to see if you’re on the right track. 

Read the intro and citations to see what prior work it builds on.

Click “cited by” to see what builds on it in the Google Scholar search results.

You can also use boolean operators for when you want to get really precise with the words in your search ("goal setting" AND ("game" OR "app")).
