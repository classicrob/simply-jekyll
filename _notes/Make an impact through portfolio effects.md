title: Make an impact through portfolio effects
tags: PersonalReflection

 I don't just want to work on one idea at a time, because then I'm learning slowly and what I learn may be confined to that specific context. If I am able to implement many ideas at once and draw connections across them, then I'll build better mental models of how the world works.
 
 Likewise, not every idea is a winner. That being said, if I shoot enough shots, I'll find the winners and learn how to more reliably produce them. In general, this is how I approach creativity as well. I generate more ideas than anybody could possibly use, and then I narrow down.
 
 Portfolio effects are a big reason why Iâ€™m consulting now. By implementing my ideas with of multiple products experiencing varied problems with unique user groups and contexts, I am able to see which ideas are robust, which have value, and which ideas deserve to be scaled. This allows me to usefully [[Learn by going up and down the ladder of abstraction]].
 
 This is also why I enjoy working with [[Spark Wave]]. The [[Startup Foundry]] model is built for [[Hyper learning]] across portfolios of startups.
 
 Long term, I see myself running a startup studio / consultancy hybrid firm.
