title: Goal Resonance
---
When an app is goal resonant, it takes the users actions (the inputs) and amplifies/transforms them into goal achievement (the outputs). Apps that are goal resonant enable the user to bridge the [[Intention-Behavior Gap]]. It is important to [[Speak to the user with a shared vocabulary]] so they know that the app is goal resonant.

Persuading people to do behaviors that are out of alignment with their goals and values is an uphill battle. Since [[Products are fundamentally voluntary]], the only way you're really going to do that is through coercion. It's much easier to design products that facilitate people in doing what they want to do given that they bought your product in the first place.
