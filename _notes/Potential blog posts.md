My choice between using Whimsical vs. Figma. It's a little bit lower floor, but it's a higher ceiling. Might as well? [link](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1349878603337535488)

My RoamGames submission and what's conceptually interesting about it

Theories of everythign

RCTs aren't always the answer

Things to do with bro Colli and chocolate 

There is a trend where Apps built for power users go from having a more complex GUI to having a minimal interface that lets the user control things seamlessly. [[Removing GUI elements as the user's skill level increases]]

What is an app built for learnability?

Tacit knowledge common in Readmes and that programmers in general take for granted 

What would an IDE for writers look like?
* Snippets
* Spell check
* Structural management
* Advanced formatting and export customization

Continuous onboarding can come from the community

Problems that new terminal users face that I don't think need to be problems

A quick overview of how I see different PKM apps

Exploratory browsing, exploratory search, and focused search
* Focused search a lot of advanced search stuff
	* Advanced twitter search to only see results from people you follow is cool, but what about a search that's limited to any tweet you've ever seen before?

Streak counters are a weak signal of habit strength. Habits aren't even the right thing to focus on in a lot of ways.

One of the hardest things about studying online communities, especially if you're interested in creating new communities, is that most of the examination of successful communities happen after they've been around for a while. You're jumping in during the middle of their journey. https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1347279213951258625

	* It’s a great project to learn to code- use a better language
	* Things could be way prettier
	* Simplify the controls
	* 40 years of baggage
Why didn't I stick with Notion?
