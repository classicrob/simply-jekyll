title: Products are fundamentally voluntary
---
People can always choose to use the product, use an alternative, or use nothing at all. In fact, not using your product is their default state of being, and you’re trying to get them to do something different in using your product. [[Adoption requires a baseline of user involvement in order to overcome inertia]].

It’s easier to facilitate people doing something that they want to do than it is to convince them to do something they don’t want to do. It’s easier to enhance their desire for something they already wanted than to instill a new desire. It's easier to meet people where they are than it is to ask them to do something that is too challenging. This is why it's crucial to design for [[Goal Resonance]] and [[Difficulty Matching]].

This points towards the necessity of using [[Behavioral Product Strategy]]. People need to use the app, and they need to do it in a certain range of ways in order to make the app work for them. 

[[It’s not enough for products to be usable]].  As I explain in [[Habits are the wrong thing to focus on for most behaviorally designed applications]], deliberate action is required at all stages, increasing the importance of understanding [[User Goal]]s and what to do with them.
