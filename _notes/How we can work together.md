I'm flexible with the ways that I tend to work with clients so what you see below shouldn't be taken as the only possibilities, though there are a few patterns that my engagements tend to follow. I generally work to improve adoption or retention through improving [[User Involvement]]. See: [[Designing for user involvement has positive effects on adoption, retention, and virality]]

### We always start with exploration
This helps us understand the ways we can work together long term. This often comes in the form of a behavioral audit or a workshop (of varying degrees of formality).

**In the behavioral audit,** I'll analyze your product and talk with you and members of your team about business and user objectives to gain an impression of your product. After a few weeks, you will receive a report of how your product is currently influencing user behavior and directions to explore for a more goal-driven [[Behavioral Product Strategy]].

**In a workshop,** my goal is to orient you and your team around the right questions to begin developing a behavioral product strategy. One example of this is a workshop where we [[Use a badging system as a method of actionable user research]]. Soon afterwards, you'll receive a summary of what I believe the main takeaways should be.

Occasionally, it will be clear through discussion that your organization has unique needs. In these cases, I generate customized workshops of varying degrees of formality from my [[Lenses of behavioral science and game design principles]] that are relevant to your situation. These allow us to combine my knowledge of behavioral influence with you and your team's knowledge of your company's context.

### The next engagement is based on what we uncover in exploration

From the first engagement, it tends to be clear what our next steps will be.

**The most flexible type of engagement is a retainer. This is for teams that work fast on dynamically changing priorities.** This includes includes ongoing discussion to hone an evolving strategy in response to a dynamic situation, as well as stewardship and commentary over time on initiatives to implement said strategy. As [[Every app is designed for behavior change, intentionally or unintentionally]], my role here is to make sure you and your team are thinking through the proper questions in the right way to influence user behavior intentionally. 

**It will often be the case that the exploration engagment reveals a distinct project where you would want me in a more involved role.** An example of this might be if I need to come up with your onboarding or retention strategy for you.

One type of engagement that I have been curious to explore more is **a series of tailored educational workshops with the dual goal of maximizing your product and facilitating team growth.** Learning through doing is the best way to learn how behavioral science and game design insights work in practice. This would follow a general cycle of learning about the company's current challenges, finding the relevant [[Lenses of behavioral science and game design principles]], facilitating a workshop with the team, and then I would review and help hone the ideas to be implemented.
