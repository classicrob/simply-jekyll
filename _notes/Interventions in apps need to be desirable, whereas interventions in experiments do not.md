#BehavioralProductStrategy

With experiments, you might find that some intervention is capable of changing behavior. This generally happens in a context where the participant is being paid or obligated in some other way to use the intervention. Participants are randomly selected from a population so self-selection into an intervention condition doesn't occur. This is because if self-selection into experimental conditions occurs, the experimenter will not know whether the intervention worked because of the intervention or because of special characteristics of the people who chose that intervention.

Since [[Products are fundamentally voluntary]], then self-selection becomes not just important, but necessary contextual information to meaningfully interpret and extrapolate from the results. An intervention needs to be effective at influencing behavior given that people choose to use it. If it's shown to be effective only in an experimental setting where participants are obligated to participate, then we still don't know if it will work in the wild.

This is why it's important to [[Design products to study its users in the relevant contexts]]. Allow the users to reveal to themselves what they want in conjunction with how their behavior is changed, because you can't disentangle the two in actual product usage.
