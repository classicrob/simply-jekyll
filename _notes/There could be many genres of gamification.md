A genre of games is a set of games that deal with a common set of problems and attempt to deliver a similar experience while varying a range of common conventions.

Let's go ahead and lump points, badges, and leaderboards together into the "Foursquare genre" of gamification. What might other genres of gamification in software products look like?

We need more genres because most of the gamification we have is [[Lazy gamification]]. A relatively homogenous configuration of points, badges, and leaderboards have been slapped onto a heterogenous set of problems, so who can be surprised when the solution doesn't fit the problem. We need more varied tools!

Over the course of my career, I hope to nurture the emergence of multiple genres as I [[Make an impact through portfolio effects]]. Eventually, the genres and their boundary conditions will be well enough understood that we can cross genre lines.

At this point, I'm figuring out the genres. It's still not entirely clear which configurations of ideas can be generalized. I'll share them as I crystallize and test them across situations. This is why I'm [[Hyper learning]].
