The Relative Price Effect says that if Good A becomes more attractive relative to Good B, then more of Good A and less of Good B should be consumevird. **Motivation Crowding Theory** refers to any time people behave opposite to the predictions of the Relative Price Effect.

According to MCT, Motivation exists on a spectrum.

People move along the spectrum because of:

	* External intervention changes their internal motivation (IM)
* Change in perceived situation
	* External intervention changes the personal category of IM
