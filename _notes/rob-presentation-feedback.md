Structure

This was the weakest area and I'm not a friend of the feedback sandwich, so I'll
lay it on right at the start. There is positive feedback coming up, too.

- When you announced the most important lesson (about feedback loops), it was forty minutes into the presentation. At this point, you'll have lost half of the audience, I estimate. Instead of structuring the presentation as a linear story (what GuidedTrack is, how it came about, the trial and error of various onboarding methods), I would structure it around concepts (hard problem of onboarding vertical products, intuitive design → building intuitions, feedback loops, explainers, floor/ceiling etc.).
- When you talk for more than an hour minutes, I think it becomes hard for people to stay engaged. I would limit myself to forty-five minutes, which would also help me focus on the most important.
- You didn't say what you're going to cover. During the presentation, you didn't say where you were. This made me feel helpless and wonder how long it's going to last. I would give an outline in the beginning and orient people in it after each section of the talk. Seems dry and boring, but it works.


Setup

- Light and sound were set up well, which made it easy to see and hear you. Keep
  it up.
- You wore a shirt, which made you look professional.
- There was no guidance for the viewers on how to set up Zoom for a presentation with screen sharing. So they either have to fiddle and figure it out themselves, or see a suboptimal version of your presentation. I would briefly tell people the right Zoom setting.
- The camera looked at you from below, which shows you in an unflattering way. I would put it at eye level or slightly above. Probably this would also help you keep your eyes fixed on the camera.


Delivery

- You smiled and talked fluently. You answered questions without hesitation. This made me think that you know your material well.
    - For example, you responded to the question about a projectional editor with the Scratch example and how contextual autocomplete could fulfil the same purpose. This was great.
- You delivered with energy and enthusiasm. This must be hard when talking into a camera. I'm impressed.
- Figma instead of slides is a good idea, but not quite there yet.
    - When you move around, and zoom in and out, it creates too much visual noise, which is distracting.
    - Zooming out and showing the big picture is a good idea. Unfortunately, Figma doesn't render it in a way where one could really understand the big
      picture.
    - Have you tried Prezi? It's nonlinear, which you appear to be fond of. ;-) And I think it would make the moving and zooming more precise. Here is a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJpXwRsz7og
- You handled the ‘LOVE HIM’ comment and confusion without skipping a beat. I was impressed.


Content

- *goto with numbers makes it look scary. I would have used text labels.
- I learned some things about my own work. For example, your Tripetto comparison convinced me that code can be easier than a GUI. I was aware of that for my own nerdy needs, but I didn't realize that it can be true for ‘normal’ people, too.
- The low floor/low ceiling concept is useful.
- ‘The hard problem of onboarding horizontal products’ – I had worried about this before, but I had never put a name on it. Well done!
