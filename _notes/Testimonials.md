### Adam Taylor
*Cofounder and CEO of [[Fabriq]]*

"These days, it's all too easy to think you’re implementing effective behavioral design principles after reading a few articles, or a one-off conversation with someone who’s “done it before”, but Rob provides the kind of expertise that product design teams are unlikely to possess in-house, even if they are well schooled in UI/UX/CX. Rob’s contribution to our “goal & reward” system redesign was not only a crucial correction to our process and the direction we took the work, but it was an educational opportunity for our team(s) that gave us additional lenses through which to view our work that will pay dividends down the line.” 

### Oliver Sauter
*Cofounder and CEO of [Worldbrain's Memex](https://getmemex.com/)*

"So far I've worked with Rob on design challenges for multi-user collaborative curation and annotation for Memex. His passion for knowledge management systems and understanding of the tools on the market made his input extremely valuable. In just a few sessions we managed to refine my raw ideas and find smart solutions to tricky and daunting UX problems. 10/10 would work with him again in the future. "

### Spencer Greenberg

### Lyudmil Angelov
*Cofounder and CTO of [GuidedTrack](https://www.guidedtrack.com/)*

"Rob’s work on our user onboarding flow has been crucial to ensure users are successful with our product. In user interviews, he has a knack for finding moments when the user is experiencing something interesting and getting them to talk about it. More often than not, this leads to valuable insights and opportunities for substantial quality improvement."

### Eddie Liu

I give him my highest recommendations."
