Self-efficacy is the belief that you are capable of doing some action, otherwise phrased in here as [[The user believes that they are capable of performing actions within the app]].

Self-efficacy is associated with (Bandura, 1998):
	* setting higher standards in relation to goals
	* greater effort, persistence, and concentration
	* adopting a flexible approach to overcoming problems
	* treating errors as learning experiences
	* lower stress arousal
	* fewer intrusive negative thoughts and greater success visualization
Essentially, people care more, adopt more of a growth mindset, and have a higher tolerance for friction. As such, building self-efficacy is a valid method to [[Intentionally design for failure states]].
