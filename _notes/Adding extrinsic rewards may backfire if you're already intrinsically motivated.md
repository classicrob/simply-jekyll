If people are already motivated to do something, then adding in extrinsic rewards on top will often crowd out (as opposed to supplement) the underlying intrinsic motivation. This is supported by research in [[Self-Determination Theory]] in psychology and [[Motivation Crowding Theory]] in behavioral economics.

However, that wording carries some moralistic connotations. "People *should* be intrinsically motivated to run, so we shouldn't add extrinsic motivators." Additionally, it's imprecise. Intrinsic motivation is generally operationalized in experiments as "baseline activity level." [[Promberger, M., & Marteau, T. M. (2013). When do financial incentives reduce intrinsic motivation? Comparing behaviors studied in psychological and economic literatures. Health Psychology, 32(9), 950-957. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0032727::rmn]]

For these reasons, I prefer to reframe it as "Adding extrinsic rewards may backfire if you already have a high baseline activity level."
