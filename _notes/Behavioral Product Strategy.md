The way the product is designed shapes the way that people use it. [[Every app is designed for behavior change, intentionally or unintentionally]], so the questions that drive behavioral product strategy must be addressed. [[User Involvement]] is a set of metrics whose success is defined by the combination of user behaviors that help the user accomplish their goals with your app. **Behavioral product strategy is designing your product so people are likely to use it in ways that improve user involvement.**

People come to the application with goals that they were struggling to accomplish on their own. The fact that they are attempting to resolve a struggle means that the user values a successful outcome. In order to resolve their struggle, they need to use your app and they need to use it well. 

If the app is what enables the user to reach a desirable goal resolution, then you have won the user over. Improve User Involvement in order to improve user outcomes, and define product success around your ability to do that. 

This is where behavioral science proves its worth for product decisions. By understanding users and their behavior through these lenses, we are able to 
* Design a product that people want to use
* Facilitate, encourage, and enable them to use the product to its fullest potential to accomplish the goals that they have.
