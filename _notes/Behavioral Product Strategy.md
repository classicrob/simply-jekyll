The way a product is designed shapes the way that people use it. [[Every app is designed for behavior change, intentionally or unintentionally]], so the questions that drive behavioral product strategy must be addressed. [[User Involvement]] is a set of metrics whose success is defined by the combination of user behaviors that contribute towards creating a desirable outcome. **Behavioral product strategy is making product decisions to influence user behavior and improve user involvement.**

It doesn't matter what features you have if people don't use them to accomplish a goal. When people achieve a goal using your product that they were previously struggling to achieve on their own, then you've won their [[User Involvement]]. This creates a positive feedback loop: they'll behave in ways that enable them to accomplish their goals and accomplishing the goals reinforces the value of their current style of usage. [[Designing for user involvement has positive effects on adoption, retention, and virality]].

[[Products are fundamentally voluntary]]. People can always choose to use the product, use an alternative, or use nothing at all. In fact, not using your product is a consumer's default state of being, and youâ€™re trying to get them to do something different in using your product. The goal of behavioral product strategy is to turn usage of your product into a default behavior for certain goals.

This is where behavioral science proves its worth for product decisions. By understanding users and their behavior through these lenses, we are able to 
* Design a product that people want to use
* Facilitate, encourage, and enable them to use the product to its fullest potential to accomplish the goals that they have.
