Behavioral Product Strategy is making better product decisions through the lenses of user psychology and behavioral influence. Ignore it at your own risk, since [[Every app is designed for behavior change, intentionally or unintentionally]].

When executed well, people will use the product in the best ways possible to deliver meaningful value to themselves and to the company. For this reason, [[I design for successful goal achievement and playstyles that are appropriate for the user]].

Behavioral product strategy encompasses product design, messaging, and company decision making processes. My specialty is in product design, but my work rarely stays perfectly siloed. How people behave and interpret the world is important when you want to make something people want to use, which has to happen because [[Products are fundamentally voluntary]]. *Who would have thought?* With behavioral product strategy, you can [[Satisfy the social contract between the user and the app]] and improve [[User Involvement]].
