title: Startup Foundry
---
Definition: A startup that starts startups.  Think of it like a startup accelerator mixed with VC where they generate, validate, and build initial ideas and then find outside entrepreneurs to come in and run the company, though the business model varies a lot.

I currently work as an internal [[Behavioral Product Strategy]] consultant for [[Spark Wave]] and its portfolio companies.
