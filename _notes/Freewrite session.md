I'm just freewriting for 15 or so minutes.

Today was a semi-focused day.

I actually think that I got most of my stuff done

- meeting with Oliver Sauter
- Amplitude Webinar
- finish reading chapter 2 of Engaged
- make a template in GT
- Sort my notes on preparing for Mad*Pow

And I signed up for a webinar to at the last minute. It was led by Victor Tabori (who is really working out to be a rockstar in the Roam community) and Cynthia Lou. I feel as though I didn't see much of anything there.

I'm sort of tempted to participate in the course, but nah. I'm not paying for that.

Regardless, they had a well-organized and impressive webinar. [[Cynthia Lou]] demonstrated how to do PARA in Roam. It takes 

I think that [[SquidLord]] was saying that if I just make a backlink from the specific concept back to the main concept from the page, then that creates the index for me

I could even have an index pages attribute so I could quickly filter backlinks by that. I could even just put a query at the top of the page for that page and index page.

Useful head pages is a good idea for a Roam Path to Power User lesson.

## Why I'm passionate about behavioral science in product and in gamification

People are so weird and complex, I love it. There's so much great research being done for the people who are willing to search for the info.

On top of that, we need to apply it to the world to know what works. A meta-analysis gives me an entry point into a field so I can learn its vocabulary. A theory frames the existing research in a way that changes how I view fundamental interactions. But at the same time, I think that academic behavioral science applies its principles sloppily. 

Behavioral science is essentially the study of how environmental factors and internal processes influence behavior. 

You can read many of my notes online. I have a digital garden, which serves sort of as a public store of my knowledge. I can link to it in conversations. I can draw people down a rabbit hole.

A good process for clearing links to papers:

You can collapse it all with one-tab, copy-paste the links into an email to send to me, and I'll add in the appropriate metadata. 

For a behavioral scientist, it's really useful to have a long catalog.

The problem with just having search is that you effectively are only searching it by one degree. Is the concept on any of these pages? But what if you just know what's related to that concept, and you're able to find it with linked references?

Roam, give us some fucking String search queries.
