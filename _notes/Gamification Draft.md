[[Game designers and behavioral scientists are asking many of the same questions]]. As such, I loosely define gamification as using principles of game design and behavioral science to influence voluntary user behavior. Analyzing game design is one of the best ways we have available to study and learn how to influence behavior

It's less about incentivizing and more about facilitating and enabling people to accomplish their goals.

My conceptualization of gamification is nontraditional because [[Most gamification sucks]]. When most people think about it, they think about points, badges, and leaderboards. However, [[Gamification is not one monolithic thing]].

[[Game designers have been designing for digital behavior change for longer than just about anyone]]. It's generally understood that people have to play the game in certain ways and with certain expectations in order to have fun. The game designers create the world you interact with and the rules of interaction, so it's clear that mechanics shape player behavior. I look at game design as a source of inspiration for

My definition is intentionally broad, because [[Gamification is not one monolithic thing]]. In fact, [[Most gamification sucks]]. While points, badges, and leaderboards may be useful as tools for certain problems under certain conditions, they are just that - tools.
