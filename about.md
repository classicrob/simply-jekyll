I'm Rob Haisfield, CEO of [[Behavioral Product Strategy]] and [[Gamification]] consultancy [[Influence Insights]]. I'm also a behavioral product strategist at startup studio [[Spark Wave]], where I do the same thing as I do in my consulting except I do it for portfolio companies.

Generally speaking, this means that I read a lot of behavioral science papers, I play a lot of video games, and I think about how the principles of each apply to the way that the apps functions. This is all with the aim of enabling users to better accomplish their goals. I begin to discuss ideas related to this in my pages on [[User Involvement]] and [[Behavioral Product Strategy]].

I got into this world out of a deep passion and curiosity for learning about why people do what they do. This feels to me as though one of the largest possible ways that I can [[Make an impact through portfolio effects]]. 

Behavioral product strategy is a new field that has incredible potential and much remaining to discover. Gamification, in concept, is incredibly powerful, but has been systematically misunderstood and misapplied since its beginning. [[Gamification is not one monolithic thing]], but it has been treated as such for far too long. This website is meant to be a public space for me to explore my thoughts and experience in each of these domains of study.

I'm [[Writing in hypertext]], which may produce a different reading experience from what you're used to finding online. **Think of it like a book that rearranges its pages and paragraphs for you based on your interest where all you need to do is click on whatever link sounds most appealing from a page.**
