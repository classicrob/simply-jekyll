Hi, I'm Rob Haisfield. I'm an independent [[Behavioral Product Strategy]] and [[Gamification]] consultant. [[Every app is designed for behavior change, intentionally or unintentionally]], and problems can generally be boiled down to "people are behaving differently than we hoped." **I empower you and your team to be intentional about how you shape your product to influence user behaviors.** If you're interested, here's [[How we can work together]]. 

**All you need to do is click on what is interesting.** This is a special trait of this website - by [[Writing in hypertext]], it is structured for both you and I to explore my thoughts. In a linear piece of writing, all ideas would be sequenced into one narrative. In my hypertext writing, the narrative is emergent and the ideas are associative.

Generative Influence is an open notebook. The purpose of this is to share the ideas that I'm exploring and to think in public. This means that, unlike a traditional blog, I'm showcasing many ideas that are in development rather than complete. If you'd like to see more detail or have related thoughts, feel free to leave a comment or tweet at me [@RobertHaisfield](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield). If you would like to work with me on a behaviorally informed product strategy, send me a note at [rob@influenceinsights.io](mailto:rob@influenceinsights.io).
