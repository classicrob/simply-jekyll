Welcome to my hypertext notebook. I've found hypertext as a medium to be incredibly liberating, and come with unique affordances. See [[Writing in hypertext]] for a primer on how to best consume this website. The majority of this website was written while I was working as a behavioral product strategy and gamification consultant, and has seen minimal updates since then. It discusses topics such as:

- [[Behavioral Product Strategy]]
  - [[User Involvement]]
  - [[Designing for user involvement has positive effects on adoption, retention, and virality]]
- Gamification
  - [[Intentionally design for failure states]]
  - [[Difficulty Matching]]
  - [[Most gamification sucks]]
- Onboarding
  - [[The hard problem of onboarding horizontal products]]
  - [[Continuous onboarding]]
  - [[GuidedTrack]] (case study)
- End-user Programming
  - [[Domain-specific languages as end-user software]]
  - [[End-user scripting enables creative workarounds]]
  - [A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval](https://scalingsynthesis.com/I-A-DSL-for-a-discourse-graph-with-information-entry-visualization-and-retrieval/) (on my other hypertext notebook, Scaling Synthesis)
- How I tend to work with clients
  - [[How we can work together]]
  - [[Use a badging system as a method of actionable user research]]
- My personal journey
  - [[Why I chose to consult rather than pursue a PhD]]
  - [[Hyper learning]]
  - [[About Me]]
