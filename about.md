I'm Rob Haisfield, CEO of [[Behavioral Product Strategy]] and [[Gamification]] consultancy [Influence Insights](https://www.influenceinsights.io/). I'm also a behavioral product strategist at startup studio [Spark Wave](https://www.sparkwave.tech/), where I do the same thing as I do in my consulting except I do it for portfolio companies.

Generally speaking, this means that I read a lot of behavioral science papers, I play a lot of video games, and apply the principles of each to make products people love. This is all with the aim of enabling users to better accomplish their goals. I begin to discuss ideas related to this in my pages on [[User Involvement]] and [[Behavioral Product Strategy]].

I got into this world out of a deep passion and curiosity for learning about why people do what they do. This feels to me as though one of the largest possible ways that I can [[Make an impact through portfolio effects]]. 

Behavioral product strategy is a new field that has incredible potential and much remaining to discover. Gamification, in concept, is incredibly powerful, but has been systematically misunderstood and misapplied since its beginning. [[Gamification is not one monolithic thing]], but it has been treated as such for far too long. This website is meant to be a public space for me to explore my thoughts and experience in each of these domains of study.

I'm [[Writing in hypertext]], which may produce a different reading experience from what you're used to finding online. **Think of it like a book that rearranges its pages and paragraphs for you based on your interest where all you need to do is click on whatever link sounds most appealing from a page.** However, this is just as new of a medium for me as it is for you! I have dozens of pages of content to manage at various stages of idea development. Expect this site to be different the next time you see it because I'm updating it constantly. 

Please contact me if you see typos, if there's a stub page you want me to expand upon, or if you have related thoughts to anything that you read in here! @RobertHaisfield on Twitter and rob@influenceinsights.io to email me!
