Hi, I'm Rob Haisfield. I am now a product manager (Growth and [[User Involvement]]) at [Tana](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1556773260246667264). Previously, I performed research on [Scaling Synthesis](https://scalingsynthesis.com/) (viewable in [video format here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRYIUDRwWg) ).

Before that, I was an independent [[Behavioral Product Strategy]] and [[Gamification]] consultant. Much of this website was written at that point in time, so should be viewed in that context. [[Every app is designed for behavior change, intentionally or unintentionally]], and problems can generally be boiled down to "people are behaving differently than we hoped." **I empower you and your team to be intentional about how you shape your product to influence user behaviors.**

**All you need to do is click on what is interesting.** This is a special trait of this website - by [[Writing in hypertext]], it is structured for both you and I to explore my thoughts. In a linear piece of writing, all ideas would be sequenced into one narrative. In my hypertext writing, the narrative is emergent and the ideas are associative.

This website is an open notebook. The purpose of this is to share the ideas that I'm exploring and to think in public. This means that, unlike a traditional blog, I'm showcasing many ideas that are in development rather than complete. If you'd like to see more detail or have related thoughts, feel free to leave a comment or tweet at me [@RobertHaisfield](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield).
