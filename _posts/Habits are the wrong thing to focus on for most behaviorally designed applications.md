Many people read Hooked and think to themselves, “Aha! I have discovered the key to making great products! People just need to use it all of the time and respond instantly to our whistle!”

[[Products are fundamentally voluntary]] and habits take a while to form. [[People need to make a decision to use your app]], whereas [[Nonusage is rarely a decision]]. We’re not trying to create habits - instead, we’re trying to overcome prior habits. 

Additionally, [[The behaviors that make up User Involvement tend to be effortful]]. When something is habitual, that means that it’s done thoughtlessly. How you brush your teeth is a habit. Going for a run may be a routine, but people don't hear a clicking sound and then suddenly find themselves running, wondering how that happened. Habits take time to form, and **most things that you think of as habits are actually routines**. 	[[The difference between a habit and a routine is that routines, while consistent, are voluntarily initiated::lsn]]


The behaviors we are trying to design the product for will require some level of deliberate action, as [[Adoption requires a baseline of user involvement in order to overcome inertia]]. 

If we want to [[Satisfy the social contract between the user and the app]], we have to ask ourselves: Who is habitual app usage important for? Is it helpful to the user? I elaborate on this more in [[The difference between user involvement and user engagement]].

This is why it’s so fundamentally important to focus on [[User Goal]]s. Some behaviors may *eventually* transition into habit, but most will, at best, become a routine. Deliberate action is required at all points unless you have an app that runs on its own.

[[Focusing on habits tends to encourage a minimum amount of behavior]]
