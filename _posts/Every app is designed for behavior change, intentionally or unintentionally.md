The large majority of behavioral science research can effectively be summarized as “here’s how this environmental factor impacts people’s behavior.” Usually there will be existing research and behavioral theory that gives us better mental models through which to make product decisions.

[[Game designers have been designing for digital behavior change for longer than just about anyone]], so they have some suggestions for how to handle this.
