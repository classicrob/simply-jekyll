# Adoption
---
[[Adoption requires a baseline of user involvement in order to overcome inertia]]. Designing for user involvement allows you to [[Speak to the user with a shared vocabulary]]. People design their own experience in an app through their actions, so designing for [[User Involvement]] early on means that the user will be doing actions that help them realize the value of the app. As a result, they’ll be more willing to pay.

In these notes, I tend to use adoption, conversion, and onboarding not necessarily interchangeably, but in similar contexts.

# Retention
---
User involvement and retention are so deeply intertwined that I think it’s best to reframe retention as “continued user involvement.” User involvement is incredibly goal oriented, so as [[User goals change over time]], [[Apps with continued user involvement are responsive to changing user goals over time]].
